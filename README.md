# 🚦 Traffic Light Detection System

## 📌 Project Overview
The Traffic Light Detection System is a computer vision–based project that detects traffic lights and identifies their current state (Red, Yellow, or Green) from images or video streams. This project demonstrates the practical use of image processing techniques commonly applied in intelligent transportation systems and autonomous vehicles.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect traffic lights from image or video input
- Classify traffic light color (Red / Yellow / Green)
- Apply real-world computer vision concepts
- Understand automated traffic signal recognition

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
- Image Processing Techniques

## ⚙️ Working Methodology
1. Load image or video input
2. Apply preprocessing such as resizing and blurring
3. Convert the image to HSV color space
4. Perform color thresholding for Red, Yellow, and Green
5. Detect contours to locate traffic lights
6. Classify and display the detected traffic light color
